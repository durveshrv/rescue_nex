                  Every year, the monsoons wreak havoc on Assam. However, the
                  region is currently experiencing flooding and landslides as a
                  result of exceptionally heavy pre-monsoon rainfall. The Smile
                  Foundation has taken the initiative to offer dry meals,
                  hygiene and sanitation kits, and critical kits to individuals
                  in need.
